# Predefined variables: PROJECT_DIR (contains the path to the MobilePassthrough project)

# Variables that require a reinstall when changed (./mbpt.sh install)
VM_NAME="MBPT_WindowsVM" # Can't be empty; no spaces allowed
VM_FILES_DIR="${PROJECT_DIR}/vm-files" # The folder into which all files for your VM will be saved (Can't be an empty string)
DRIVE_IMG="${VM_FILES_DIR}/${VM_NAME}.img" # The location of your VM disk (Can't be an empty string)
VM_DISK_SIZE="40G" # Required once; changing this after the drive image has been created has no effect, unless you reinstall (E.g. "40G", "250G", ...); At least "40G" is highly recommended; "30G" will probably work, but Windows will break if you use it all
INSTALL_IMG="${VM_FILES_DIR}/windows10.iso" # Path of Windows 10 ISO used during installation (Will be downloaded to that location if it doesn't exist; Can't be an empty string)

# Variables that can be changed between VM starts (./mbpt.sh start)
CPU_CORE_COUNT="auto" # "auto" is recommended (e.g. "8", "12" or "auto"); "auto" uses all, but one core, but no more than 16
RAM_SIZE="auto" # "auto" is recommended (e.g. "8G", "10G" or "auto"); "auto" uses [all free RAM]-1GB, but no more than 16GB

DGPU_PCI_ADDRESS="auto" # E.g. "01:00:0" or "auto", "auto" will use the fist dGPU it finds (if more than one, you will be asked which one to use; after 10 seconds it will timeout and use the fist one); see output of lspci
IGPU_PCI_ADDRESS="auto" # Only Intel iGPUs supported atm; recommended to leave on "auto"; Use "" to disable or "auto" to automatically detect it (recommended); required for mediated iGPU passthrough. you can check your iGPU PCI address using lspci
DGPU_PASSTHROUGH="auto" # "auto", "true" or "false" ("auto" Recommended) "auto" will enable it if the system has more than one GPU
SHARE_IGPU="auto" # "auto", "true", or "false"; only works for Intel iGPUs atm; "auto" will enable it automatically if an Intel iGPU is detected; Recommended to save battery life (this is mediated iGPU passthrough using GVT-g)

DGPU_ROM="" # Optional (Can help getting rid of error 43); Use "" to not load a vBIOS ROM or specify a path to one (e.g. "${VM_FILES_DIR}/vbios-roms/vbios.rom")
IGPU_ROM="" # Optional (Can help getting rid of error 43); Use "" to not load a vBIOS ROM or specify a path to one (e.g. "${VM_FILES_DIR}/vbios-roms/igpu-vbios.rom")
PATCH_OVMF_WITH_VROM="true" # "true" or "false"; Recommended to avoid Error 43; (Doesn't do anything, unless you specify a DGPU_ROM or IGPU_ROM)

MAC_ADDRESS="auto" # Required (E.g. 00:11:22:33:44:55 or auto to generate a new one with every VM start)
NETWORK_MODE="bridged" # Supports bridged or none
SMB_SHARE_FOLDER="" # Optional; for example "${VM_FILES_DIR}/vmshare" or "" to not use it

VIRTUAL_INPUT_TYPE="virtio" # "usb-tablet", "virtio" or "". If keyboard input doesn't work properly for you, you may want to use "virtio" instead of "usb-tablet"

OVMF_CODE="/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd" # Path to the unmodified OVMF_CODE image
OVMF_VARS="/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd" # Path to the unmodified OVMF_VARS image
OVMF_VARS_VM="${VM_FILES_DIR}/OVMF_VARS_VM.fd" # Path to where a copy of the unmodified OVMF_VARS image will be created automatically

HELPER_ISO="${VM_FILES_DIR}/mobile-passthrough-helper.iso" # Required for automated driver installation, looking glass setup, IP setup, remote desktop setup etc. inside of the VM

LOOKING_GLASS_MAX_SCREEN_WIDTH="1920" # 1920 Recommended (bigger resolutions will result in a bigger buffer with worse performance)
LOOKING_GLASS_MAX_SCREEN_HEIGHT="1080" # 1080 Recommended (bigger resolutions will result in a bigger buffer with worse performance)
LOOKING_GLASS_VERSION="B4" # B4 Recommended

DISPLAY_MODE="4" # ("4" is the only working one atm) Display mode to use (e.g. 1 or 2 ... see scripts/utils/common/plugins)

USE_SPICE="true" # Recommended for Windows installation and required for Looking Glass and QXL
SPICE_PORT="5904" # 5900 is the normal port, but it may already be used by something else on your system like VNC
USE_SPICE_CLIENT="true" # Recommended for installation

USE_FAKE_BATTERY="true" # Recommended to avoid Error 43

VM_START_MODE="qemu" # "qemu" is recommended ("qemu" or "virt-install")

# USB devices to pass through automatically while the VM is running. Separated by semicolons!
